# Encrypt Decrypt Tool in Java

This is a program to encrypt and decrypt files or folders. <br>
<br>
The algorithm used is symmetrical and without keystore, for ease of implementation.<br>
The point of this project is not to create a production grade encryption tool, but rather to learn Java better.<br>
<br>
The code quality is necessarily low, considering this is one of my very first projects
